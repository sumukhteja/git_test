    <title>Lists: Ordered and Unordered</title>
  </head>



  <body>
    The only difference in the ordered and unordered lists are the type of bullets used.
    Ordered list has numbered bullets signifying there is a sequence/order to be followed.
    Whereas the unordered list follows a simple bullet signifying there is no sequence/order.
    <p>The Ordered list starts and ends with <strong>ol</strong> element:</p>

    <ol>
  <li> The fist thing item in the list starts and ends with li inside the ol </li>
  <li>So does the second item </li>

    </ol>

    <p>The Unordered list starts and ends with <strong>ul</strong> element:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is the first item in the list, starts and ends with li</li>
      <li>Likewise, this is the second item in the list</li>
    </ul>
