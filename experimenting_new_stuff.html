<h1>The optimistic BRI - Belt and Road initiative, revival of the silk road</h1>
<h2>Claims in the South China Sea and the disputes with the bordering nations</h2>
<h3>Pilot Digital Currency project</h3>
<h4>One China policy - On Hongkong and Taiwan</h4>

<h6>Re-education camps(Concentration camps) for Uighur Muslims in the Xinjang province</h6>




<p>The above headings have been created by using h1, h2, h3...upto h6 elements only!. There is no h7. So don't add h7 in the body element </p>
<strong>This statement is printed in bold since I used a 'stong' element.</strong>
<p>I can also make a statement which can highlight words in the sentence like I used strong on <strong>THIS WORD</strong>. Same goes for emphasis that is shown below. </p>
<p>Likewise I can make a statement with italics on the whole sentence or words with 'em' element.</p>
<p>This is a great thing since I <em>obviously understood</em> what this does!</p>
