<head>

  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>My First website</title>

</head>




<body>

<p>I'm doing this for the first time. This is the first line in the first paragraph tag that I wrote.
  I really understood what has been going on. I am going to explain what I did to get here. </p>

  <p>Open open your editor and start typing the following things, First: type DOCTYPE html tag right on top.</p>
  <p>Second: The html tag, that is both opening and closing tags. Note: All tags need to have opening and closing tags. Closing tags start with / inside the <> </p>
  <p>Third: Head tag followed by body tag</p>
  <p>Fourth: The head tag contains things like meta charset="utf-8" tag and the title tag</p>
  <p>Fifth: The body tag contains all the information I want to type. I used the paragraph tag to distinguish the paragraphs.
    It helps when you want to make bullet points and decluster the information for better reading </p>



<p>After doing this I am going to push this into the GitHub repository so that people can check out my basic HTML skills and the advanced skills yet to come.
  Also, I am going to learn the VCS i.e., Git software. Once I master it, I am going to use the terminal to write all my commands.
  See, for now I think I got the thing about the basic syntax of a HTML document so far. I'm doing good. All thanks to The ODIN Project.</p>


<p>Observation 1: I see that I need to learn how to add images, bold the characters that I'm writing, italics, font. Add more pages like Home, About, Contact us page etc.</p>
